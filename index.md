## Data Structures and Algorithms

In this course, students will learn about the correct programming structures, abstractions and algorithms that are necessary for improving the efficiency and scalability of a computer program. Topics will include data structures, learning about algorithmic complexity. Each topic will be augmented by a programming task that demonstrates the use of algorithms and data-structures.
